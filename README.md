## MuziKa!

<i>MuziKa!</i> is a musical ear-training web application in which the user must guess the pitch of a musical degree after a musical progression is played.

<b>Notice:</b> To fully appreciate this app, a base knowlage of music theory and interval harmony is required.

## Tech used

- React
- React-Router
- [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Motivation

This app was developed out of my love of both programming and music.
